    /// The traditional C-style practice of using argv + argc is an example of a "buffer + length" anti-pattern.
    /// Because the two must be manually coupled, this pattern has not only been shown to be a source of bugs (eg.
    /// off-by-one errors or buffer-a + length-of-buffer-b-errors) but also a security vulnerability (whenever the two
    /// are misaligned, we risk enabling an exploit).  Using a buffer which manages its own length (ie. std::vector)
    /// ensures these kinds of issues cannot happen.
    ///
    /// All strings managed by this app are strongly-typed UTF-8 strings, which permit the use and proper operation
    /// of any Unicode code point and prevent accidental use by non-UTF-8-aware operators.  All operations on strings
    /// are Unicode-compliant, except for equality, which will only perform a literal compare, not a Unicode-semantic
    /// compare (the latter is when a set of code points is considered equal to some other code point or set of code
    /// points).
    ///
    /// While C and C++ strings can hold UTF-8 data, no C or C++ string operators are UTF-8-aware, and ignoring this can
    /// lead to both surprising and incorrect behavior with the added bonus of the problem being completely silent
    /// (until it manifests in some way).  To deal with this, this application uses a strongly-typed UTF-8 string class
    /// to prevent accidental use of non-UTF-8-aware string manipulation functionality.
